This directory stores curated redistributable fixtures for deterministic tests.

Guidelines:
- Only include libraries whose license explicitly permits redistribution (MIT, BSD, Apache, zlib, ISC).
- Store a small checksum file alongside each binary, e.g. `zlib1.dll.sha256`.
- Add a short `LICENSE.txt` or reference for each fixture.

Currently this is a scaffold; please add vetted binaries and license notes.
